## Model View Controller

You HAVE to design apps this way so get used to it!

ViewController.swift

```swift
import UIKit
class viewController: UIViewController{

}
```
Using control and dragging our UI card, we're able to determine characteristics for an object. An _action_ making it simply a method (similar to Java). Under arguments, you can select _sender_, or a single argument.
